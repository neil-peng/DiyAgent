Prologue by the Chorus of the City, and first meet with Lysander, Elara, and Cassian.

Enter the Chorus of the City.
Chorus:
O ye that tread the dust of lost desire, mark well the tale of strife and fire,
Where vengeance, sown in ashes, doth aspire to ruin all but mercy's pale attire.
This city, once a lute that sang in concord's key, now breathes in chords of dissonance,
Where roofs are dreams doth crumble, and the streets wear scars as a mourning veil.

Enter Lysander, in cloak of night, blood on his blade, eyes like storm-swept seas.
Lysander:
What light through yonder ruin breaks? It is the sun of justice—nay, a blade
That leans toward treachery's mercy when the heart is sated with revenge.
O Elara! Thou art the balm in which a bleeding world would wash its wounds,
Yet I, thy husband, see not healing but a chain that binds my fists in iron.

Elara enters: a healer, calm, with a patient hand.
Elara:
My lord, thy brow is thunder, yet thy words, like sparrows, flutter near the edge of doom.
Let not thy mind be bent by memory's bootless ache. The past is a stern tutor,
But forgiveness is a living herb that grows where hatred's roots would fret.

Cassian enters, proud, with a fanfare of trumpet-like lies.
Cassian:
Hail, Lysander—nay, king no more, but tyrant of thy own despair—
For I have planted thee a crown of slights, and thou hast raised it with thy blood.
Remember how the fortun'd hour favored me, and thou wert left to drown in ash. 
The city’s loss is but thy gain, if thou wouldst taste it, ere it withers.

Lysander turns, drawn by a sudden gust of wind, revealing a battered banner bearing the emblem of their house, now tattered and stained.
Lysander:
Thou traitor! thou who worest my trust as thou wouldst wear a chattel's smile,
What treason lies in thy breast, that thou should'st barter honour for a thin falcon's cry?

The Shade, a dark figure, unseen, glides behind Lysander, whispering in his ear.
The Shade:
Vengeance is but a shadow's echo, my lord; follow me and thou shalt hear thy conscience's drum.

The Oracle of Aethra speaks from the shadows in a distant tower; a voice like a bell tolling three times.
Oracle of Aethra:
Beware the road where blood is sown, for red is not the only harvest to be reaped;
The house that thrives on ruin shall itself be ruined by the hands that seek to mend it with fire.

Miren enters, in rags, eyes softened by remorse.
Miren:
I once wore the mask of murder, yet I am unmasked by a truth: redemption is a long road,
And mercy is a city of light that takes every sinner to its gate, if only we knock.

The Squire of Lysander, timid yet loyal, clings to Lysander's cloak.
Lysander:
Squire, thou art my comrade, and yet thy breath would not bend a blade's edge.
Speak truth: is vengeance a cure, or a fever that consumes the patient?

Squire:
My lord, you have been scorned, but the price of revenge is the soul's own ruin.
Yet I would bear thy shield to defend thee from thy fiercest storm, if thou wilt but listen a while.

Chorus:
Thus begins a tale of fire and mercy, where shifts of fate do pull like tide and wind.
If forgotten prayers may mend the ruined roofs and hearts, then let our stage be set for mercy's wind.

End of entry: the city gathers, the ground trembles; the storm gathers, and with it, the reckoning to come.
